FOR ENTERPRISE LEVELS ONLY - Up-to-date database tables for new installations or "out-of-sync" sites to reinstall network database tables and data.

New installations of the enterprise level are guided through the process by the script to create the Manna Network databases, users and tables on their sites and to then fill those tables with the latest categories and links of the distributed web directory. 

These are the files that their script will install and/or that are available for manual installation.
